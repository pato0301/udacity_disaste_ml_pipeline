# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

Figure Eight has provided data related to messages, categorized into different classifications, that have been received during emergencies/disasters. This project try to recognize these categories in order to cater for quicker responses to the emergency messages. Using machine learning techniques, (Random Forest Classifier) we shold be able to predict the category.

### The process was carried out as follows:

1. Data Processing Assessing and cleaning the data, so that it can be utilized by machine learning algorithms. See details in the ETL Notebook.

2. Model training Data was passed through a pipeline and a prediction model is made. See details in the ML Notebook.

3. Prediction and Visualization Making a web app for prediction and visualization, where user may try some emergency messages and see visualization of distribution of genres and categories.

# Install

# Project motivation

For this project, I use the Figure Eight disaster response data to build a classifier that flags messages for various emergency services.
